# UFOs
Wk11
# Overview of Project: 
## Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
# Results: 
## Now the enhanced interface will allow the user to filter the UFO sighting data by 5 fields: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of object sighted.  Please go ahead and fill in each respective search box, hit the enter, and the table will be filtered by the search criteria you entered!
# Summary: 
## This design is considered well tailored for your use, but:
### - 1 drawback is that you can't search through the keywords in the Comments section, because you may want to filter the sighting by words such as "New Year Day", or "travelling southeast" for filtering by further detais.
### - Improvement#1: Entering each of city/state/country is kindo of redundant; maybe entering city can allow state and country to be filled in automatically.
### - Improvement#2: Building a Search box that will allow text string in the Comments, such as "no sound", or "Two crafts" for easy keywords look up.
